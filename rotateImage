#So this code is to rotate the 2d array clockwise
#The goal is to change columns to rows and rows to columns
#To rotate the array clockwise I will have to grab the first index of from the last group to the first group and append it to the new array.
#To make a 2d array in python I have to make a single array in python and then append an empty array to it
#then fill the 2d array one column at a time.

def rotateImage(a):
    b=[]
    print(a)
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(i)
        b.append([])
        for j in range(len(a)):
            b[i].append(a[len(a)-1-j][i])
    print(b)
    return b
